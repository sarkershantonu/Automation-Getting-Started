	Explanation
-- ⊗	Report pseudo allocation traces. Pseudo traces are derived from currently active trace events. ↪
--/prefetch:1[1] ⊗	/prefetch:# arguments to use when launching various process types. It has been observed that when file reads are consistent for 3 process launches with the same /prefetch:# argument, the Windows prefetcher starts issuing reads in batch at process launch. Because reads depend on the process type, the prefetcher wouldn't be able to observe consistent reads if no /prefetch:# arguments were used. Note that the browser process has no /prefetch:# argument; as such all other processes must have one in order to avoid polluting its profile. Note: # must always be in [1, 8]; otherwise it is ignored by the Windows prefetcher. ↪
--/prefetch:2[1] ⊗	No description ↪
--/prefetch:3[1] ⊗	No description ↪
--/prefetch:4[1] ⊗	No description ↪
--/prefetch:5[1] ⊗	/prefetch:# arguments for the browser process launched in background mode and for the watcher process. Use profiles 5, 6 and 7 as documented on kPrefetchArgument* in content_switches.cc. ↪
--/prefetch:6[1] ⊗	No description ↪
--/prefetch:8[1] ⊗	Prefetch arguments are used by the Windows prefetcher to disambiguate different execution modes (i.e. process types) of the same executable image so that different types of processes don't trample each others' prefetch behavior. Legal values are integers in the range [1, 8]. We reserve 8 to mean "whatever", and this will ultimately lead to processes with /prefetch:8 having inconsistent behavior thus disabling prefetch in practice. TODO(rockot): Make it possible for embedders to override this argument on a per-service basis. ↪
--0 ⊗	Value of the --profiler-timing flag that will disable timing information for chrome://profiler. ↪
--? ⊗	No description ↪
--accept-resource-provider ⊗	Flag indicating that a resource provider must be set up to provide cast receiver with resources. Apps cannot start until provided resources. This flag implies --alsa-check-close-timeout=0. ↪
--account-consistency[2] ⊗	Command line flag for enabling account consistency. Default mode is disabled. Mirror is a legacy mode in which Google accounts are always addded to Chrome, and Chrome then adds them to the Google authentication cookies. Dice is a new experiment in which Chrome is aware of the accounts in the Google authentication cookies. ↪
--adaboost ⊗	No description ↪
--aec-refined-adaptive-filter ⊗	Enables a new tuning of the WebRTC Acoustic Echo Canceler (AEC). The new tuning aims at resolving two issues with the AEC: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=5777 https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=5778 TODO(hlundin): Remove this switch when experimentation is over; crbug.com/603821. ↪
--agc-startup-min-volume ⊗	Override the default minimum starting volume of the Automatic Gain Control algorithm in WebRTC used with audio tracks from getUserMedia. The valid range is 12-255. Values outside that range will be clamped to the lowest or highest valid value inside WebRTC. TODO(tommi): Remove this switch when crbug.com/555577 is fixed. ↪

--allow-external-pages ⊗	Allow access to external pages during layout tests. ↪
--allow-failed-policy-fetch-for-test ⊗	If this flag is passed, failed policy fetches will not cause profile initialization to fail. This is useful for tests because it means that tests don't have to mock out the policy infrastructure. ↪
--allow-file-access-from-files ⊗	By default, file:// URIs cannot read other file:// URIs. This is an override for developers who need the old behavior for testing. ↪

--allow-no-sandbox-job ⊗	Enables the sandboxed processes to run without a job object assigned to them. This flag is required to allow Chrome to run in RemoteApps or Citrix. This flag can reduce the security of the sandboxed processes and allow them to do certain API calls like shut down Windows or access the clipboard. Also we lose the chance to kill some processes until the outer job that owns them finishes. ↪
--allow-outdated-plugins ⊗	Don't block outdated plugins. ↪
--allow-ra-in-dev-mode ⊗	Allows remote attestation (RA) in dev mode for testing purpose. Usually RA is disabled in dev mode because it will always fail. However, there are cases in testing where we do want to go through the permission flow even in dev mode. This can be enabled by this flag. ↪
--allow-running-insecure-content ⊗	By default, an https page cannot run JavaScript, CSS or plugins from http URLs. This provides an override to get the old insecure behavior. ↪

More details here: - http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models - The class comment in site_instance.h, listing the supported process models. IMPORTANT: This isn't to be confused with --site-per-process (which is about isolation, not consolidation). You probably want the other one. ↪
--process-per-tab ⊗	Runs each set of script-connected tabs (i.e., a BrowsingInstance) in its own renderer process. We default to using a renderer process for each site instance (i.e., group of pages from the same registered domain with script connections to each other).

--remote-debugging-address ⊗	Use the given address instead of the default loopback for accepting remote debugging connections. Should be used together with --remote-debugging-port. Note that the remote debugging protocol does not perform any authentication, so exposing it too widely can be a security risk. ↪
--remote-debugging-port ⊗	Enables remote debug over HTTP on the specified port. ↪
--remote-debugging-socket-fd ⊗	The given value is the fd of a socket already opened by the parent process. This allows automation to provide a listening socket for clients to connect to before chrome is fully fired up. In particular, a parent process can open the port, exec headles chrome, and connect to the devtools port immediately. Waiting for chrome to be ready is then handled by the first read from the port, which will block until chrome is ready. No polling is needed. ↪
--remote-debugging-socket-name[6] ⊗	Enables remote debug over HTTP on the specified socket name. ↪
--remote-debugging-targets ⊗	Porvides a list of addresses to discover DevTools remote debugging targets. The format is <host>:<port>,...,<host>:port. ↪

--reset-variation-state ⊗	Forces a reset of the one-time-randomized FieldTrials on this client, also known as the Chrome Variations state. ↪
--restore-last-session ⊗	Indicates the last session should be restored on startup. This overrides the preferences value.

--safebrowsing-disable-download-protection ⊗	TODO(lzheng): Remove this flag once the feature works fine (http://crbug.com/74848). Disables safebrowsing feature that checks download url and downloads content's hash to make sure the content are not malicious. ↪
--safebrowsing-disable-extension-blacklist ⊗	Disables safebrowsing feature that checks for blacklisted extensions. ↪
--safebrowsing-manual-download-blacklist ⊗	List of comma-separated sha256 hashes of executable files which the download-protection service should treat as "dangerous." For a file to show a warning, it also must be considered a dangerous filetype and not be whitelisted otherwise (by signature or URL) and must be on a supported OS. Hashes are in hex. This is used for manual testing when looking for ways to by-pass download protection. ↪
--SafeSites ⊗	No description ↪
--sandbox-ipc ⊗	Causes the process to run as a sandbox IPC subprocess. ↪
--save-page-as-mhtml ⊗	Disable saving pages as HTML-only, disable saving pages as HTML Complete (with a directory of sub-resources). Enable only saving pages as MHTML. See http://crbug.com/120416 for how to remove this switch. ↪

--simulate-upgrade ⊗	Simulates an update being available. ↪
--single-process ⊗	Runs the renderer and plugins in the same process as the browser ↪
--site-per-process ⊗	Enforces a one-site-per-process security policy: * Each renderer process, for its whole lifetime, is dedicated to rendering pages for just one site. * Thus, pages from different sites are never in the same process. * A renderer process's access rights are restricted based on its site. * All cross-site navigations force process swaps. * <iframe>s are rendered out-of-process whenever the src= is cross-site. More details here: - http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/site-isolation - http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models - The class comment in site_instance.h, listing the supported process models. IMPORTANT: this isn't to be confused with --process-per-site (which is about process consolidation, not isolation). You probably want this one. ↪
--skip-gpu-data-loading ⊗	Skip gpu info collection, blacklist loading, and blacklist auto-update scheduling at browser startup time. Therefore, all GPU features are available, and about:gpu page shows empty content. The switch is intended only for layout tests. TODO(gab): Get rid of this switch entirely. ↪

Has no effect unless --trace-shutdown is also supplied. Example: --trace-shutdown --trace-shutdown-file=/tmp/trace_event.log ↪
--trace-startup ⊗	Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup. Optionally, can specify the specific trace categories to include (e.g. --trace-startup=base,net) otherwise, all events are recorded. Setting this flag results in the first call to BeginTracing() to receive all trace events since startup. In Chrome, you may find --trace-startup-file and --trace-startup-duration to control the auto-saving of the trace (not supported in the base-only TraceLog component). ↪
--trace-startup-duration ⊗	Sets the time in seconds until startup tracing ends. If omitted a default of 5 seconds is used. Has no effect without --trace-startup, or if --startup-trace-file=none was supplied. ↪
--trace-startup-file ⊗	If supplied, sets the file which startup tracing will be stored into, if omitted the default will be used "chrometrace.log" in the current directory. Has no effect unless --trace-startup is also supplied. Example: --trace-startup --trace-startup-file=/tmp/trace_event.log As a special case, can be set to 'none' - this disables automatically saving the result to a file and the first manually recorded trace will then receive all events since startup. ↪
--trace-to-console ⊗	Sends a pretty-printed version of tracing info to the console. ↪
--trace-to-file ⊗	Sends trace events from these categories to a file. --trace-to-file on its own sends to default categories. ↪

--unsafely-allow-protected-media-identifier-for-domain ⊗	For automated testing of protected content, this switch allows specific domains (e.g. example.com) to skip asking the user for permission to share the protected media identifier. In this context, domain does not include the port number. User's content settings will not be affected by enabling this switch. Reference: http://crbug.com/718608 Example: --unsafely-allow-protected-media-identifier-for-domain=a.com,b.ca ↪
--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure ⊗	Treat given (insecure) origins as secure origins. Multiple origins can be supplied. Has no effect unless --user-data-dir is also supplied. Example: --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://a.test,http://b.test --user-data-dir=/test/only/profile/dir ↪
--use-angle ⊗	Select which ANGLE backend to use.

--use-file-for-fake-audio-capture ⊗	Play a .wav file as the microphone. Note that for WebRTC calls we'll treat the bits as if they came from the microphone, which means you should disable audio processing (lest your audio file will play back distorted). The input file is converted to suit Chrome's audio buses if necessary, so most sane .wav files should work. You can pass either <path> to play the file looping or <path>%noloop to stop after playing the file to completion. ↪
--use-file-for-fake-video-capture ⊗	Use an .y4m file to play as the webcam. See the comments in media/capture/video/file_video_capture_device.h for more details. ↪
--use-first-display-as-internal ⊗	Uses the 1st display in --ash-host-window-bounds as internal display. This is for debugging on linux desktop. ↪

--utility-cmd-prefix ⊗	The contents of this flag are prepended to the utility process command line. Useful values might be "valgrind" or "xterm -e gdb --args". ↪
--utility-run-elevated ⊗	No description ↪
--utility-sandbox-type ⊗	Type of sandbox to apply to the utility process. Options are "none", "network", or "utility" (the default). ↪
--utility-startup-dialog ⊗	Causes the utility process to display a dialog on launch. ↪
--v ⊗	Gives the default maximal active V-logging level; 0 is the default. Normally positive values are used for V-logging levels. ↪
--v2-sandbox[7] ⊗	Enable the V2 sandbox during the helper executable initialization. ↪
--v2-sandbox-enabled[7] ⊗	The command line paramter indicating that the v2 sandbox is enabled. This must be different than the "v2-sandbox" flag to avoid endless re-executing. The flag tells the sandbox initialization code inside Chrome that the sandbox should already be enabled. TODO(kerrnel): Remove this once the V2 sandbox migration is complete, as processes will be assumed to run under the V2 sandbox. ↪
--v8-cache-options ⊗	Set options to cache V8 data. (off, preparse data, or code) ↪

Additionally, unlike chrome://translate-internals, the value isn't persisted across sessions. ↪
--variations-server-url ⊗	Specifies a custom URL for the server which reports variation data to the client. Specifying this switch enables the Variations service on unofficial builds. See variations_service.cc. ↪

--video-threads ⊗	Set number of threads to use for video decoding. ↪
--video-underflow-threshold-ms ⊗	Allows clients to override the threshold for when the media renderer will declare the underflow state for the video stream when audio is present. TODO(dalecurtis): Remove once experiments for http://crbug.com/470940 finish. ↪
--virtual-time-budget ⊗	If set the system waits the specified number of virtual milliseconds before deeming the page to be ready. For determinism virtual time does not advance while there are pending network fetches (i.e no timers will fire). Once all network fetches have completed, timers fire and if the system runs out of virtual time is fastforwarded so the next timer fires immediatley, until the specified virtual time budget is exhausted. ↪
--vmodule ⊗	Gives the per-module maximal V-logging levels to override the value given by --v. E.g. "my_module=2,foo*=3" would change the logging level for all code in source files "my_module.*" and "foo*.*" ("-inl" suffixes are also disregarded for this matching). Any pattern containing a forward or backward slash will be tested against the whole pathname and not just the module. E.g., "*/foo/bar/*=2" would change the logging level for all code in source files under a "foo/bar" directory. ↪
