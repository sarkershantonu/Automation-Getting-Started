Feature: valid search

  Scenario: Going to Opencart and search an item
    Given I open chrome browser
    When I type http://demo.opencart.com/ and press enter
    Then I can see page loaded with title "The OpenCart demo store"
    And I type "Iphone" in search box And I click search button
    Then I can see search results with title "Search - Iphone"
    And I can see the search should not take more than 10 second
    Then I quit browser
